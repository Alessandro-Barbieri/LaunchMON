2009-08-26 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@lnll.gov>
	* launchmon/src/lmon_api/*.h,
	config/x_ac_prefix_config_h.m4: Added lmon-config.h support
	(prefixed config macros) to all header files that are
	 externally exported.


2009-08-15 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Yet another cut to enhance error handlings; better
	P/T state tracking system is used to handle idiosyncrasy 
	of Linux process control


2009-06-03 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Better enforcement of the error handling semantics. 
	* Added test.attach_4_kill for BlueGene.
	* Made ptrace errors in tracer_detach "a soft error" 
	  instead of a hard error that throws an exception.


2009-06-01 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Added a minor bug fix to detect the master thread ID correctly.
	  (A bug introduced by one of changes made on 2009-05-20)
	* Upped the grace period by x10 bewteen two consecutive signals
	  to overcome unreliable UNIX signals. For some platforms,
	  it turned out that sending SIGSTOPs to all the threads (lwp)
	  of the target process did not cause all of them to stop
	  with a short grace period...


2009-05-20 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Added LMON_fe_regErrorCB support (ID2787962)
	* Added a fix for the "re-attach" defect on BlueGene/P. 
	  The fix requires the IBM efix27 or higher.
	* Added a fix for the back-end and front-end [recv|send]UsrData functions
	  to return correct error codes. Added a new error code 
	  (LMON_ENEGCB) to lmon_api_std.h to deal with a
	  negative code returning from user-provided 
	  pack/unpack callback routines. (ID2787959) 
	* Changed the library version to -version-info 1:0:1.
	  It is because this revision added new API calls and 
	  bug fixes for existing API calls.


2009-03-11 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Generalized the BlueGene support in support of BGP
	  Configure's --with-rm option now takes "bgrm" instead of 
	  bglrm or bgprm.
	* Deprecated the GLUESYM support in favor of indirect
	  breakpoint support.
	* launchmon/src/linux/sdbg_linux_ttracer_impl.[hxx|cxx]
	  launchmon/src/linux/sdbg_linux_thr_db.[hxx|cxx]:
	  Added runtime linking support for the thread_db library,
	  and deprecated the static configure check for
	  that library defined in config/x_ac_thread_db.m4.
	* Deprecated the library version of ciod_db as IBM
	  open-sourced the CIOD debugger interface codes 
	  entire via a header file.
	* configure.ac
	  launchmon/src/linux/lmon_api/lmon_fe.cxx:
	  Bug fix in the pthread_cond_timedwait
	  return code checking logic for launchmon engine 
	  connection: the only correct return code
	  from pthread condition wait is zero; there were
	  are two call sites testing with the less-than-zero 
	  conditions for an error.
	  Added comm_pair_e for readability
	  Added configure check for env, ssh|rsh, and totalview.
	  

2008-12-12 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* added x_ac_testnnodes.m4 and modified test driver scripts 
	  to make test cases more configurable. New options
	  are supported through --with-testnnodes and
	  --with-ncore-per-CN.  
	* added x_ac_bootfabric.m4 and x_ac_rm.m4 to better
	  support bootscraping comm. fabric and RM support 
	* removed x_ac_pmgr_collective.m4, x_ac_slurm_srun.m4
	  and x_ac_bgl_mpirun.m4 
	* changed several configuration options and their style
	  --with-bootfabric[=FABRICTYPE]
	  --with-gcrypt[=ARG]
	  --with-rm[=RMTYPE]
	  --with-rm-launcher[=LAUNCHERPATH]
	  --enable-verbose[=LOGDIR]
	* Made --with-bootfabric --with-rm --with-gcrypt mandatory 
	  options for simpler yet better confiration support

2008-09-30 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Enforced LaunchMON error handling semantics and update man pages
	* Fixed an incompatibility issue introduced into the 2.6.18 
	  Linux kernel's thread_db 
	* Added a verbose mode with an ability to redirect the verbosity
	  info into files 
	* Added two-phased polling scheme to the engine
	* Bug fix for not handling BGL 64-bit mpirun's MPIR_Breakpoint
	* Bug fix for a memory corruption in the handshape routine 
	  at large scale 
	* Added an LaunchMON handler that delivers signals (except for SIGSTOP) 
	  sent to the RM_job process back to the RM_Job process
	* Added consistent return code support for LMON_be_sendUsrData 
	  and LMON_be_recvUsrData for all calling back-end daemons 

2008-06-18 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Added GNU build system support and restructure the source tree.
	* Added PMGR Collective support
	* Added BlueGene/L support including 64 bit mpirun support
	* Added better support for LaunchMON engine to determine
	  the return address of a breakpoint. Some architectures
	  like POWERPC make this info visible via their register
	  sets while others via the stack memory locations 

2008-03-06 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Added FE-engine FE-BE timeout support
	* Added timeout support for fe_detach, fe_kill, 
	  and fe_shutdownDaemons, too 
	* Added better verbosity support for remote use of launchmon engine. 
	* Added test.attach_3_callsafterfail
	  	test.attach_3_invalidpid
		test.attach_3_invalidpid_remote	

2008-02-21 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Added man pages for the back-end API
	* CHAOS4 packaging support
	* Added LMON_fe_getProctabSize support
	* Added LLNS copyright and LGPL terms and conditions 
	* Added LMON_be_getMyProctabSize support to support STAT better
	* Added local launchMON engine invocation in addition to remote 
	  invocation method. This is a more general solution 
	  Passing NULL to launchAndSpawn or attachAndSpaw now
	  results in invoking the engine locally 
	* Introduced a better shared data access policy 
	  to the front-end API implementation, and enforced the
	  policy to avoid race conditions 

2008-02-06 Dong H. Ahn <ahn1@llnl.gov>
	* Added man pages for the front end API 
	* ChangeLog file created
